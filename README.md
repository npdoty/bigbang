# BigBang

BigBang is a toolkit for studying communications data from collaborative
projects. It currently supports analyzing mailing lists from Sourceforge,
Mailman, or [.mbox][mbox] files.

## Installation

You can use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). This will also install
the `conda` package management system, which you can use to complete
installation.

[Install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), with Python version
3.*.

If you choose not to use Anaconda, you may run into issues with versioning in
Python. Add the Conda installation directory to your path during installation.

Run the following commands:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/datactive/bigbang.git
conda create -n bigbang
cd bigbang
bash conda-setup.sh
source activate bigbang
```

(If you use a different conda environment name, you'll need to modify
`conda-setup.sh` to match.)

### pip installation

Alternatively you can use `pip` for installation. Run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datactive/bigbang.git
# optionally create a new virtualenv here
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
```

## Usage

There are serveral Jupyter notebooks in the `examples/` directory of this
repository. To open them and begin exploring, run the following commands in the root directory of this repository:

```bash
source activate bigbang
ipython notebook examples/
```

### Collecting mail archives

BigBang comes with a script for collecting files from public Mailman web
archives. An example of this is the
[scipy-dev](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/scipy-dev/) mailing list page. To
collect the archives of the scipy-dev mailing list, run the following command
from the root directory of this repository:

```bash
python bin/collect_mail.py -u http://mail.python.org/pipermail/scipy-dev/
```

You can also give this command a file with several urls, one per line. One of these is provided in the `examples/` directory.

```bash
python bin/collect_mail.py -f examples/urls.txt
```

Once the data has been collected, BigBang has functions to support analysis.

## Git

BigBang can also be used to analyze data from Git repositories.

Documentation on this feature can be found [here](https://github.com/datactive/bigbang/blob/master/git-readme.md).

## Unit tests

We use `unittest` for automated tests.

To run the tests from the command like, use the command `pytest`.
